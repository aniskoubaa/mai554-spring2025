## 📋 Modules

### Machine Translation with Transformers

The machine translation module explores using transformer-based models for translating text between languages. It includes activities on:

- Using pre-trained models for basic translation
- Evaluating translations with metrics like BLEU score
- Understanding transformer model architectures
- Fine-tuning models on custom datasets

To get started with this module:
```bash
cd machine_translation
```

For more details, see the [Machine Translation README](machine_translation/README.md).
