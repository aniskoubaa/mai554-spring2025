# 🌍 Machine Translation with Transformers 🤖

This module focuses on machine translation using transformer-based models from Hugging Face. Through various activities, you'll learn how to implement, evaluate, and optimize machine translation systems.

## 📂 Activities

This module contains several activities:

1. **Basic Translation** - Simple examples of using pre-trained models
2. **Translation Evaluation** - Evaluating translations using BLEU scores
3. **Model Architecture** - Exploring transformer model architectures
4. **Fine-tuning** - Fine-tuning translation models on specific datasets

## 🛠️ Common Requirements

All activities require:
- Python 3.8+
- Hugging Face Transformers
- PyTorch
- NLTK (for BLEU score calculation)

Refer to individual activity README files for specific requirements and detailed instructions.

## 🌐 Language Pairs

The activities support various language pairs, including:
- English to German
- English to French 
- English to Spanish
- English to Arabic
- And many more through pre-trained models

## 💡 Getting Started

To get started, navigate to one of the activity subfolders and follow the instructions in its README file.

```bash
cd basic_translation
python simple_translation_example.py
```
